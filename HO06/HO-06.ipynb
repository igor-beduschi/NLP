see what you mean  i was so\\nintent on explaining how jung thought we could be more moral than god that\\ni overlooked your main line of thought\\n\\nyou seem to be saying that god being unknowable his morality is unknowable\\n\\nyep thats pretty much it im not a jew but i understand that this is the\\njewish way of thinking however the jews believe that the covenant between\\nyhwh and the patriarchs abraham and moses in this case establishes a moral\\ncode to follow for mankind even the jews could not decide where the boundaries\\nfall though\\n\\nas i understand it the sadducees believed that the torah was all that was\\nrequired whereas the pharisees the ancestors of modern judaism believed that\\nthe torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\\nthe required morality in all its nuances talmud\\n\\nthe essence of all of this is that biblical morality is an interface between\\nman and yhwh for a jew or christian and does not necessarily indicate\\nanything about yhwh outside of that relationship although one can speculate\\n\\n\\nthe first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created\\nin his image so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever\\nmoral code he follows as part of trying to live up to that image  if we\\nare supposed to live by christs example you would be hard pressed to\\nargue that god is a do what i say not what i do kind of guy\\n\\nthe trouble with all of this is that we dont really know what the created\\nin his image means ive heard a number of different opinions on this and\\nhave still not come to any conclusion this rather upsets the apple cart if\\none wants to base a life script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphors\\nunashamedly as to living by christs example we know very little about\\njesus as a person we only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\\nby his followers and some very small references from comtemporary historians\\nrevelation aside one can only know christ secondhand or worse\\n\\nthis is not an attempt to debunk christianity although it may seem that way\\ninitially the point im trying to make is that we only really have the bible\\nto interpret and that interpretation is by humanity i guess this is where\\nfaith or relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness\\n\\n\\nmetaphysically if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\\nabsolute moral code and i think this is theologically questionable\\n\\nno there may be an absolute moral code there are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes the multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode as an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is wrong now the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar where there are no children the wrongness here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent the parent may feel that it is inappropriate\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals the analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but\\nyou get the gist of it incidentally the young child considers the directive\\nas absolute until he gets older see piaget and learns a morality of his own\\n\\ndavid\\n\\n\\non religion\\n\\noh where is the sea the fishes cried\\nas they swam its clearness through\\n\\n', 'from

a gift  a more exotic car  front runners\\nincluded the toyota supra turbo and the porsche 924 1987 model years\\ni narrowed it down to those two  i liked the simplicity and handling\\nand snob appeal too of driving a porsche  the supra turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance  almost a personal luxury\\ncar  it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924\\ni was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924 but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way  i asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car\\n \\nif you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe celica the 85 celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer  our lowerrisk division will continue\\nto handle your account\\n \\nif you buy the porsche 924 well have to change you to the standard\\nhigher rate company and your rate will double  and if you go with\\na 944 its another story again  well cover the rest of this year\\nbut cancel you after that\\n \\nbut the supra is much faster than the 924 and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the standard 944  that doenst make sense\\n \\n thats what the book says  we dont insure corvettes either  for\\nsome reason the underwriters consider supras  and their drivers \\nas very traditional and conservative\\n \\ni eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons  the porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure\\nguy in the back room  at equal monthly payments it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance  i\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related

users\\n\\nquite true  speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around\\nthan magazines though\\n\\n  a misfire in a semiauto will require you to clear a jammed shell\\n   first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often\\n   lost as you realize hey its jammed before starting to do anything\\n   about clearing it\\n\\ntrue but this is a training function\\n\\n  most

only carry modes that make sense  the 80 series colts for\\nexample are quite safe to carry this way\\n\\n  there are some doubleaction semiautos out there but the complexity of\\n   operation of many

see clearing paragraph above  about the worst that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed  this can be cleared in seconds\\n\\nmost revolvers are more fragile then semi autos  there are all sorts\\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved  dropping the gun or a\\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action  many\\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a quality semi auto\\ntake a gun smith for a revolver  in short a revolver may be less likely\\nto malfunction but as a rule when it does youre out of the fight\\nthe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\\ninto that category\\n\\nvincint makes many good points in this post but leaves off the opposing\\nview of most of them  a real good starting place is ayoobs the semi\\nauto pistol for police and self defense\\n\\nin general id agree the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time and

designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian\\n    system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a titan ivcentaur in october of 1997\\n    after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga\\n    trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004 upon\\n    arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens\\n    probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter\\n    continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and\\n    targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturns atmosphere\\n    rings and magnetosphere conduct closeup studies of saturns\\n    satellites and characterize titans atmosphere and surface\\n\\n    one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere\\n\\n    the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini 16251712 the\\n    first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of\\n    saturns satellites and the major division in its rings the titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan\\n    huygens 16291695 who discovered titan

useless when im home\\ni wish i could get a batteryless ups to use it with or use it with a heavy\\nduty 5volt regulator to supply the pc but i guess youd need 5v and 12v \\nand 12 too 2 more batteries \\n\\nan alternative would be to leave a 40 amp battery charger hooked up to the battery\\nand run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time and when the power\\ngoes out voila  the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery  and\\nthen i could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips \\n\\n\\n \\nharry langenbacher 8183549513

 nevertheless khomeini offered a cash prize for people to\\n take the law into their own hands  something which to my\\n understanding is against islamic law\\n\\nyes this is also my understanding of the majority of islamic laws\\nhowever i believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all\\nfive schools of law 4 sunni and 1 jaffari can be levelled against\\nmuslim or nonmuslims both within and outside daralislam i do\\nnot know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and\\nopen hostility to islam falls into this category of the law i do know\\nthat\\nhistorically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone\\nby the death penalty\\n\\nmy understanding is that khomeinis ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy alone it was well known that rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the quran hadith or in islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy\\n\\ni believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that of fasad this\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nislamic state and it can be carried out by individuals the reward was\\nnot offered by khomeini but by individuals within iran\\n\\n\\n stuff deleted\\n also i think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that\\n khomeinis fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book  my\\n understanding is that khomeinis fatwa was issued in response to the\\n _writing_ and _publishing_ of the book  if my view is correct then\\n your viewpoint that rushdie was sentenced for a crime in progress is\\n incorrect\\n \\ni would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what i remember was\\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\\nof the book however the charge of fasad can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges i remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between britain and iran over the fatwa  iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\ncrisis but you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people not books\\n\\nthe rushdie situation was followed in iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa rushdie went on a media blitz\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred \\nfanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book he was everywhere in the media then\\nmuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the muslims and defend his sacred rights it was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on fasad was issued\\n\\nthe fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie  any actions of\\nrushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling the book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers the fatwa\\nagainst the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well the\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being\\nplayed out and played up in the the full view of the media\\n\\nps im not sure about this

officers\\nassociation of the united states has alerted the defense base\\nrealignment and closure commission that the services failed to give\\nsufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close\\n56 naval and marine corps reserve centers\\n   in letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of\\ncongress with affected locations in their constituencies including\\nsen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services\\ncommittee roa charged that the developers of the navymarine list\\nignored demographics of the civilian population particularly prior\\nservice personnel\\n   roas executive director maj gen evan l hultman aus ret\\nsuggested concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the naval reserve\\ncomponents from maintaining even todays relatively low level of\\nparticipation in their parent services total force of the future\\n   he asked the commission to remove from consideration all\\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\\nwarrant approval of the requested action\\n   only a few of the 56 naval and marine corps reserve\\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\\nimpact on the community if closed wrote hultman  the major\\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\\npercentage of the existing locations\\n   hultman reminded the commission the fact that the vast\\nmajority of the reserve installations on this list do not come\\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\\nprocess certainly supports the thesis that these actions are\\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the navy and\\nmarine corps reserve\\n   roa also noted that at the end of the 1960s when the number of\\nnaval reservists was approximately the same as today there were 480\\nnaval reserve facilities  if the navy recommendations are\\napproved there will be less than 200 naval reserve facilities\\n   facilities on the list include seven naval air stations ranging\\nfrom south weymouth mass to alameda calif 28 naval\\nreserve centers in macon ga and parkersburg wva to\\nmissoula and great falls mont  navalmarine corps reserve\\ncenters include four in san francisco fort wayne ind\\nbillings mont and abilene texas\\n   a major marine reserve center on the list is
